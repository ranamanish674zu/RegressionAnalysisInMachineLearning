.
I have make a simple regression line in lineaer and logistic regreesion with help of machine learning concepts.
This are the important libraries which i have used--->
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np 
from sklearn import datasets,linear_model
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
=>
let's have a look on regression line -->
